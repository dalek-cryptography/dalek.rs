(mostly) with rustdoc (and then sometimes edited manually).

# Warning

Caveat emptor: If you are a professional web developer, you are going to
absolutely detest the code in this repo.  Imagine a website designed by someone
who literally twiddles bits for a living, and then imagine that they used nearly
no tools to create it, other than emacs and a terminal.  That's what this site
is.  It is so vomit-inducingly horrendous that your eyes may fall out when you
look at the (hand-written) HTML.  There's inline CSS.  This site was created
with an *incredibly* outdated version (v2.3) of Bootstrap, because that's the
only version of Bootstrap where I could get the BOOTSTRA.386 theme to work.  If
you look at this code, and your eyes fall out, the authors are not liable for
the hospital bills to put them back in.  Consider yourself warned.
